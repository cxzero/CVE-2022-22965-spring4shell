CVE-2022-22965 Spring4Shell research &amp; PoC

Based on the initial research I did on https://github.com/GuayoyoCyber/CVE-2022-22965 with these additions:
- modifications on HelloWorld class and helloworld.jsp for a better understanding of the vulnerability 
- added Apache Tomcat 9.0.60 embed library dependency for debugging purposes

## Compilation
```
sudo apt install maven
mvn clean package
```
Apache Tomcat 9.0.60 can be downloaded from https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.60/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.60.zip

Smart Tomcat IntelliJ plugin can be used to speed up running and debugging: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9492-smart-tomcat

sudo docker build -t spring4shell .
```
or
```
sudo docker build -t spring4shell -f Dockerfile2 .
